          <p> Implemented the long sought "Post-Publish Delete" feature. This feature allows clients to keep deduplication in sync after documents have been exported out of the processing engine. Furthermore, I refactored the feature for performance--Discovered the need to batch delete queries for documents. This reduced the amount of calls being made to the SQL server by an order of roughly 10,000 -- the maximum size of a given batch; Eliminated time spent waiting for statistics to be aggregated on deleted documents by reporting asynchronously.</p>
          <p> Implemented a feature to allow clients to re-run the Extract Transform Load pipeline with updated settings, and therefore modify/update the metadata itself or how it's calculated. </p>
          <p> Implemented an API that would query and calculate the number of documents related to the given one.</p>
          <p> Updated the functional test framework to be environment-aware: testing environments now clean up debug-resources that could cause noisy neighbor issues and/or potentially prevent full/accurate coverage of the codebase.</p>
          <p> I Was recognized for going above and beyond by handling the majority of the On-Call incidents during my shift unassisted by Level 2 support. Due to this I was promoted to Level 1 Support so that I can help mentor more junior members of the department in supporting the application.</p>
          <p> Eliminated duplicate code paths, in the functional tests that cover Export, by a factor of 4.</p>
          <p> Extended the nightly functional test pipeline and jobs to run in phases so as to eliminate noisy neighbor issues caused by disparate functionalities being tested against the same environment. Over time I have updated the existing timeouts for different phases--to more accurately account for the durations of each phase. Additionally, a timeout was added to the final phase of the nightly pipelines so that we can guarantee a given run doesn't interfere with the next.</p>
          <p> Implemented the ability for end users to query, pivot, and group by the aforementioned API(s) regarding whether or not a given document has been exported.</p>
          <p> Implemented the ability for end users to pivot, group by, and create graphs and widgets on the results of the queries returned from the API(s) mentioned in the previous bullet.</p>
          <p> Increased transparency into the processing engine. Implemented a feature that allowed users to see all of the files extracted and transformed by the engine. Driven by modular apis that allow users to create expressions to narrow down their searches, this API has become the main method by which Relativity queries for document metadata.</p>
          <p> Mentored an Intern through two projects: refactoring functional tests to be more economical in their database usage; developing a script to refactor tests; and implementing a jenkins job to trigger an upgrade of only the processing engine, whereas previously all applications had to be updated.</p>
