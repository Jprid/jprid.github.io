    Space Graph Game
    Finds path from one point in space (NxN array representing the "map" of space) to another, avoiding obstacles on the way. 
    
    Dynamic Memory System
    64-byte aligned heap for dynamic memory allocation. 4x faster than the memory system inherently used by C++.
    
    Particle System
    Refactored legacy code that draws toliet paper roll unravelling in order to optimize performance. Code draws the particles of a toilet paper roll as it unravels. Optimizations made program run 7.82x faster.
